# Alternative Processing bundle for TextMate 2

## Description
TextMate 2 currently inclues a sub-par Processing bundle.

I am working on updating the once excellent Processing bundle for TextMate by peon: https://github.com/peon/processing.tmbundle

This is a bundle for [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate). Now you can work on your [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketch, run, present, and export all from within TextMate. The Processing language will also be properly understood and highlighted along with included useful snippets and reference material.

## Updates

Processing is no longer included with the bundle (this is a good thing).

You must download the latest version of Processing:
http://processing.org/download/

You must then install the command line support for Processing:

## Request

This bundle is still undergoing testing and improvement.

Please add any suggestions or issues to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TrevorSayre/Processing.tmbundle/issues).
