# Alternative Processing bundle for TextMate 2

## Description

This is a bundle for [TextMate 2](https://github.com/textmate/textmate). Now you can work on your [Processing](http://processing.org/) sketch then run, present, and export all from within TextMate. The Processing language will also be properly understood and highlighted along with included useful snippets and reference material.

## Shoulders of Giants

TextMate 2 currently inclues a Processing bundle:  
https://github.com/textmate/processing.tmbundle

There also exists the once excellent Processing bundle for TextMate by peon:  
https://github.com/peon/processing.tmbundle

The included bundle is sparse and the bundle by peon is massively out of date. I will be combining ideas from both and developing an up-to-date approach to Processing sketch development in TextMate 2.

## Instructions

Processing is no longer included with the bundle (this is a good thing).

You must download the latest version of Processing:  
http://processing.org/download/

You must then install the command line support for Processing:  
http://wiki.processing.org/w/Command_Line

You can then finally install this bundle and begin making sketches in TextMate 2.

## Request

This bundle is still undergoing testing and improvement.

Please add any suggestions or issues to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/TrevorSayre/Processing.tmbundle/issues).
